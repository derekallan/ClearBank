## Disclosure

- Actual time spent was probably a little over 1.5hrs

## Just Some General Notes

- I took some liberty with the project structure as there was nothing in the rules against it
  - Generally the project follows a domain structure broken into accounts and payments.
- Enabling nullable was definitely overkill and "polishing" the solution
- Add factories to wrap conditional creation of derived classes
- "Builds on my machine" - every dev
- All test pass and code coverage is 80.61% of the main project and 98.68% of Payment which is really what matters
- Make sure I go change this repo to private after the interview...
